# Database

### A database interaction module based on PDO

---

I didn't want to import big libraries and packages<br/>
The intention is to keep my apps as slim and as close to clean php as possible<br/>
I got the idea from from Zak Horton's [Slim 4 Authorization Tutorial ](https://github.com/zhorton34/authorize-slim-4) to create my own.<br/>

---

This package is part of a series of packages to create a modular skeleton ap for fast, lightweight simple application development<br/>
I wanted a self maintened "micro framework"<br/>

---

It is free to use and modify as you see fit.<br/>
I recomend forking it because it's purpose is for personal use and I will only maintain it as long as I find it useful for myself.

It contains Database interaction methods, an ActiveRecord class and a Migration class, it also contains a migration template to be used to generate migrations via console commands and a RecordInterface to be used with models.
